# Node Chain Management (POC)
---

![Application Image](/images/app.jpg?raw=true "Application UI")

---
This application is built on .Net Framework 4.5 and is a WinForm application.
To Open, Compile and Run -> simply open the .sln file through Visual Studio (preferably 2015 - since that's the IDE used to built this project and it may not work on previous versions of Visual Studio).

You can directly run the project by running the .exe present in /bin/Debug/PosistNode.exe

The UI is very intuitive an hence self-explanatory, for any further queries fell free to contact on 
```sh

```

Some Starter Points -> 

- Add New -> This button is used to clear the node details and make the form in a ready state to generate a new node
- Save Node -> This button is what actually does the saving.
